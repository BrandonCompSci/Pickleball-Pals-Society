            Brandon Gautier
        </h3>

        <div class="text">
            Brandon's passion for sports was evident long before he had discovered pickleball.
            As a child, he would often be found playing soccer and badminton with the other
            neighborhood children. When he grew older, Brandon focused his sporting efforts on 
            cross-country running. It was no surprise that the moment he stepped onto the
            pickleball court, he was hooked. Pickleball included aspects from all of his favorite sports - it was challenging like soccer, nuanced like badminton, and competitive like running.

            <br>
            
            Like most enthusiasts, he wants the sport of pickleball to expand to a wider audience.

            Brandon enjoys teaching newcomers how to play - so much so, he became a certified 
            instructor with the National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) in 2023. His coaching sessions focus on making the learning process both fun and informative.
