            As ambassadors for the sport, our mission is to cater to players of all ages, skill 
            levels, and abilities. We host a number of different events throughout the year, 
            ranging from casual to competitive. Our current calendar includes indoor/outdoor
            recreational play and DUPR rating sessions. In the future, we intend to host
            tournaments and learn-to-play clinics.
