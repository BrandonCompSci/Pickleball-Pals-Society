                    In a round-robin "scramble", you sign-up as an individual and play doubles matches with different random partners each game. Each participant will play  8 games. Games will be played to 11, win by 1. There will be no elimination rounds.

                    Stats are calculated for each individual player and will be based on the total number of points earned throughout the course of the event. Every point counts!

                </h2>

                <div>
                    A more detailed explanation on scoring is provided below: 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Players A and B have both completed two games. Player A scores 11-1 in game 1 and 8-11 in game 2. Player B scores 10-11 in game 1 and 10-11 in game 2. Player A's cumulative score would equal 19 (11+8). Player B's cumulative score would equal 20 (10+10). Despite losing both games, Player B would be 1 point ahead of Player A and thus ranked higher on the leaderboard.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    In the case of a tie, the following tie-breaks will be used:

                    <ol style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        <li>The total number of points earned.</li>
                        <li>The total number of wins.</li>
                        <li>The greater cumulative point differential. (e.g., 11-1 would equal +10, whereas 1-11 would equal -10)</li>
                    </ol>
